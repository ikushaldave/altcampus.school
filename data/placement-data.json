I was raised in Mumbai and am currently staying here with my folks. \n\nI studied Science in my Junior college, so obviously, I am clueless about the subject because I had different priorities back then. \n\nI later pursued a hospitality management degree and worked for two years in the hotel industry. This experience was fundamental in developing my communication skills, which means I can shoot the bull with almost anyone. I enjoy cooking and learning foreign languages. I can speak and write basic Spanish.\n\nDuring my work, I realized that the hotel industry was not the right fit for me. So, I decided to explore the world of coding, and incidentally, I was offered the opportunity to join AltCampus. I spent one-year learning software development and now am a Full-stack Software developer (it still seems unreal when I say it out loud). In hindsight, this opportunity came my way at the right time. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Bigbinary. \n\nYou will generally see me with my headphones on, bobbing my head in tune to the music. I also enjoy writing songs, short stories, and poems and am known to doodle away my time. I would love to master playing a musical instrument and have tried my hand (and lungs) at the guitar and flute. I would love to hone my skills further in Spanish and French.\n\nI am thankful for the opportunity to learn at AltCampus, which has helped me develop my coding skills, enhanced my soft skills, and exposed me to a great community that I will always cherish.",

    "experineceAtAltCampus": "My experience at AltCampus was amazing in every way. I learnt the fundamentals of web development in depth which enabled me to build useful things.\n\nThe course is well designed and everything is taught at a steady pace, we also had assignments and weekly demos where we applied the things that we learnt to build things and show it to everyone.\n\nTechnical things aside, The most valuable thing about AltCampus is its community. I got a chance to meet people from all over India with different backgrounds, made a lot of friends. I got a chance to live in the mountains and experience nature more closely which is something most of the people miss in the cities.\n\nAltCampus helped me grow as a person, I thank all of the mentors who were more like brothers to me for teaching me and supporting me throughout the course.",
