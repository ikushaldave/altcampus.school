### 1. Learn in public

Learning in public means sharing whatever you are learning publicly. It could be through tweets, blog posts, videos, cartoons etc. The idea is to teach whatever you have learnt or share whatever you have created.

It helps in keeping you accountable, consistent and motivated. You increase the surface area of getting feedback and networking with other. 

Here are a few things that you can do to get started 
-  Tweet everyday about your progress
- Write blog posts on whatever you have learnt

To get inspiration, look at the [students of AltCampus tweeting their progress publicly](https://twitter.com/search?q=AltCampus).

### 2. Solve the problem on the paper

One of the biggest problems with newbies is that they are just so excited to write code that they jump into the text editor the minute they have a problem statement. The problem with this approach is that you are actually not taking the time out to understand and think about the solution of the problem.

Resist the temptation of writing code straightaway. Code is nothing but a medium to implement the solution. Actual solution is the thought, the approach that you must come up with. 

Always keep a pen and paper handy when you are writing. Anytime you get a problem, understand it, break it down,  write steps in plain words, also called pseudo code. Solve the problem on the paper first. Once you know what the right approach is, start converting the pseudo code into actual code in your text editor.

### 3. Find a feedback mechanism. someone to give you feedback/ Code review

If you are not good at something how do you know if what you are doing is actually good? 

### 4.  Actually build something. Don't be in tutorial hell.

Simple is not easy.
